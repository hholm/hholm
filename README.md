### Hello! 🌊🚢
I am a oceanography researcher at [Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) in Columbia University](https://lamont.columbia.edu/). During my doctoral work with [MIT-WHOI](https://eaps.mit.edu/academic-programs/mit-whoi-joint-program/) I studied global factors affecting organic biogeochemical cycling in the surface ocean. Here you can find my work on open source software tools that aim to improve enviromental mass spectrometry. I am currently the maintainer of the [LOBSTAHS](https://github.com/vanmooylipidomics/LOBSTAHS) package and am developing more screening tools as part of that workflow.
